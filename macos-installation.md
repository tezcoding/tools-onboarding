# MacOS environment setup

## Git
Git will be a part of the curriculum but also to get started with this installation guide.

To check if you Git is already installed on your Mac open the Terminal then type `git version` and press return (Enter)  
If it returns git version info then you already have it installed if it says command not found. It will need to be installed. Usually when entering `git version` on a Mac that doesn't have git installed will display an installation prompt for `Xcode Command Line Tools`.  Please see image below for reference

Press `Install` and follow instructions to complete installation.
If no prompt appeared then type `git` in the terminal and press return key.
